# EndlessRunner
To do list:<br>
PRIORITY<br>
-multiple platform spawning<br>
  -> spawns randomly<br>
    -> Concsistent heights for platforms, no randomly high platforms <br>
  -> spawns with random x and y values that don't have them overlap at any point<br>
-player interacts with platforms<br>
  -> same way as player doesn't fall through ground<br>
  -> can jump up while on platform <br>
  -> player gets pushed to left of screen if player hasn't jumped on platform<br>
<br>
<br>
